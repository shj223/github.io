### Bio
Hello! My name is [Sharon Jo](https://sharonjjo.wordpress.com/) and I am a journalism major at Lehigh University.
This page was created for my data journalism class.

I am a college student & photographer based in Eastern Pennsylvania. While always searching for something new and creative to try, I mainly focus on fashion photography and photojournalism in addition to other digital mediums.

In my writing portfolio, much of the work is made up of journalistic writing. Journalism encompasses everything I love to do and enjoy: stories, creativity, information, and the strength it possesses when they are all brought together. And with photos, I am able to express what words cannot.

I am also in the process of gaining experience in the business world, having worked three internships and jobs related to marketing, multimedia, and communications. I hope to one day work as a creative director.

I hope to portray my professional and personal growth on my website, as it serves to showcase my hard work and efforts as it also serves as self motivation.
For now, I will be learning and studying and making the most of every opportunity.

Thank you for checking out my work!
â€“ Sharon

# Lehigh CAS BA Undergraduate Enrollment
This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the number of full-time students in the College of Arts and Sciences Bachelor of Arts program in the past five years. This data was found using [Lehigh's Data Center](oirsa.lehigh.edu/degree-programs). I found that there was a growing number of student enrollments, and currently, it is at its all time high. This aligns with Lehigh's Path to Prominence initative, where Lehigh is trying to increase it's undergraduate size.

# National Student Loan Information
This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the breakdown of national student loans and the data on the past ten years. This data was found using [The Washington Post](https://www-washingtonpost-com.ezproxy.lib.lehigh.edu/education/2022/05/22/student-loan-borrowers/) and [Education Data](https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics#:~:text=Report%20Highlights.,of%20all%20student%20loan%20debt.) and [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/26/your-money/student-loan-forgiveness-debt.html). I chose this topic because of Biden's loan cancellations and from being inspired to research the topic further from the New York Times article. I thought it was interesting and shocking to see how much it has changed from the past ten years.
