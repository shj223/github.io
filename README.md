### Bio
Hello! My name is [Sharon Jo](https://sharonjjo.wordpress.com/) and I am a journalism major at Lehigh University.
This page was created for my data journalism class.

I am a college student & photographer based in Eastern Pennsylvania. While always searching for something new and creative to try, I mainly focus on fashion photography and photojournalism in addition to other digital mediums.

In my writing portfolio, much of the work is made up of journalistic writing. Journalism encompasses everything I love to do and enjoy: stories, creativity, information, and the strength it possesses when they are all brought together. And with photos, I am able to express what words cannot.

I am also in the process of gaining experience in the business world, having worked three internships and jobs related to marketing, multimedia, and communications. I hope to one day work as a creative director.

I hope to portray my professional and personal growth on my website, as it serves to showcase my hard work and efforts as it also serves as self motivation.
For now, I will be learning and studying and making the most of every opportunity.

Thank you for checking out my work!
â€“ Sharon

#Lehigh CAS BA Undergraduate Enrollment
This is an infographic created using Canva that shows the number of full-time students in the College of Arts and Sciences Bachelor of Arts program in 2010, 2016, and 2022. This data was found using [Lehigh's Data Center](oirsa.lehigh.edu/degree-programs). I found that there was a dip in enrollment 6 years ago, but now it is at its highest number of enrollment.
